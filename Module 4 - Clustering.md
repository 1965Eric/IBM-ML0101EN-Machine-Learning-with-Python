## Module Introduction

In this module, you will learn about different clustering approaches. You will learn how to use clustering for customer segmentation, grouping same vehicles, and for weather stations. You will understand 3 main types of clustering including Partitioned-based Clustering, Hierarchical Clustering, and Density-based Clustering.

## Learning Objectives

* To understand different types of clustering algorithms.
* To apply clustering on different types of data sets.
