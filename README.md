# Machine Learning with Python: A Practical Introduction

## Course Overview

This course dives into the basics of Machine Learning using an approachable, and well-known programming language, Python.  We will be reviewing two main components:

* The purpose of Machine Learning and where it applies to the real world. 
* A general overview of Machine Learning topics, such as supervised vs unsupervised learning,  model evaluation, and Machine Learning algorithms. 

## Learning Objectives

In this course, you will:
* Explore examples of Machine Learning and the libraries and languages used to create them.
* Apply the appropriate form of regression to a data set for estimation.
* Apply an appropriate classification method for a particular Machine Learning challenge.
* Use the correct clustering algorithms on different data sets.
* Explain how recommendation systems work, and implement one on a data set.
* Demonstrate your understanding of Machine Learning in an assessed project.
