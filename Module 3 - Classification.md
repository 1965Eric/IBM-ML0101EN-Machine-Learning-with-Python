## Module Introduction

In this module, you will learn about classification techniques. You will practice with different classification algorithms, such as KNN, Decision Trees, Logistic Regression and SVM. Also, you will learn about the pros and cons of each method, and different classification accuracy metrics.

## Learning Objectives

* To understand different Classification methods.
* To apply Classification algorithms on various data sets to solve real world problems.
* To understand evaluation methods in Classification.
