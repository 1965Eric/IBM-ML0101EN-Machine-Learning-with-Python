## Module Introduction

In this module, you will get a brief intro to regression. You will learn about Linear, Non-linear, Simple and Multiple regression, and their applications. You will apply all these methods on two different data sets, in the lab sections. Also, you will learn how to evaluate your regression model, and calculate its accuracy.

## Learning Objectives

* To understand the basics of regression.
* To apply Simple and Multiple, Linear and Non-Linear Regression on a data set for estimation.
